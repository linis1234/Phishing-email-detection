__Sample Email:__
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a78555ba-d7c9-426d-984a-422398805ccb)
"Email Subject: Secure Your WellsFargo Online Key"
"Sender Name: Wells Fargo"
"Sender Email: inmail-hit-reply@linkedin.com"
"Date: Sat 10/22"



__Indicators of Spoofing__

Email address: inmail-hit-reply@linkedin.com

This is clearly not an official Wells Fargo domain.

The sender uses a LinkedIn InMail address, which is inappropriate for banking alerts.
 Indicator of spoofing: The message falsely claims to be from Wells Fargo.
