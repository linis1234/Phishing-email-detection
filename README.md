__Indicators of Spoofing__  

1.Email address: inmail-hit-reply@linkedin.com  

This is clearly not an official Wells Fargo domain.  

The sender uses a LinkedIn InMail address, which is inappropriate for banking alerts.  
 Indicator of spoofing: The message falsely claims to be from Wells Fargo.  


 The visible sender domain (linkedin.com) and subject content mismatch are already a strong indication of header inconsistency.  

In a real analysis, this would be checked with tools like MXToolbox Header Analyzer.  
 Suspected spoofing or redirection via misaligned headers.
